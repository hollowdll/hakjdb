# Data types

## String

String stores sequences of bytes encoded in UTF-8. This means that each character is represented by one or more bytes.

For example, String can be used to store text.

## HashMap

HashMap stores a collection of field-value pairs. In a HashMap, each field is unique meaning that there cannot be multiple fields with the same name. Fields and values are stored as Strings.

For example, HashMap can be used to store a group of properties belonging to some entity.
