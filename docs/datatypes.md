# Data types

## String

String stores sequences of bytes encoded in UTF-8. This means that each character is represented by one or more bytes.

It can be used to store text.

## HashMap

HashMap stores a collection of field-value pairs. Each field is unique, which means that there cannot be multiple fields with the same name. Fields and values are stored as Strings.

It can be used to store a group of properties belonging to some entity. For example, a person object.

The maximum number of fields a HashMap can store is 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).
